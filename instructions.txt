In order to make a connection with Airflow within Docker:

Basic connection inputs:
    - Connect by: Host
    - Host: localHost (the name doesn't matter)
    - Port: 5433 (must use a different port instead of 5432:5432 because this is mapped to another local database. Using 5433:5432, the PostgreSQL is listening on 5432, but
                  Docker is revealing port 5433 to the external user.)
    - Authentication: Database Native
    - Username/Password: airflow (or whatever it is set within the docker-compose.yml file)


1. Edit the yaml file, go to the "services:" block, and add port: 5433:5432 like so:

            postgres:
                image: postgres:13
                environment:
                POSTGRES_USER: airflow
                POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airflow
                POSTGRES_DB: airflow
                volumes:
                - postgres-db-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
                ports:
                - 5433:5432
                healthcheck:
                test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "airflow"]
                interval: 10s
                retries: 5
                start_period: 5s
                restart: always

	[Note: The ports 5433 is the port to our PC, 5432 is the port in which is where airflow is running inside the container]

2. Set up the requirements.txt file that will later be ran by the dockerfile. It will install all the dependencies for that image.

3. After spinning up airflow, within the airflow GUI, go to 'admin' > 'connections', add new connection details:
    - Create a connection name
    - Connection Type: Postgres
    - Host: host.docker.internal 
    - desciption: (optional)
    - Port: 5433 (note: this is telling airflow in docker, which is in port 5432, to listen to port 5433, which is where the database is held on our local PC)
    - Login/Password: airflow (or whatever you have set in the yml file)
    - Database: corelogic (or leave blank. If blank, it will create a database within the connection in DBeaver using the login name, but defining it will tell it to
                            send data to that specific database with that name.)

4. Create another connection for connect to SFTP or any other data source:

Credentials:
    - Connection ID: sftp_conn
    - connection type: SFTP
    - Host: ftp2.resftp.com
    - description: (optional)
    - Port: 22
    - Login/Password: Marcus&Millichap / 9wpx9Cb2
    -
